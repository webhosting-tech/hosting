If you have a website, you have probably heard of web hosting, but chances are that you aren't really sure what web hosting really means. You know you have to have a host but how do you know whether you have the right company and whether you have the best hosting for your site? This article has solid advice for helping you figure that out.

If you are hosting your site with a Linux based site, be sure the company you choose updates their information regularly, and at all levels. You don't want your page to crash or be insecure because your host is not properly maintaining their servers and networks, so look for those that do.

When selecting a web host, it's vital that you choose one that has excellent support. Although it's important for a host to have lots of experience, they can't avoid all problems. Something is bound to go wrong at some point. When this occurs, having a solid support system set up is crucial. You can test out a host's support system by sending in an email or a support ticket. If you don't receive a response within the next couple of days, then you should probably search for another host.

To prepare yourself for the experience of using a free web host, get used to the idea that you will have a lot of downtime. Staying up all the time takes some specialized equipment that free hosts don't really have the budget for. As a result, your site may be down more than it is up.

You should always back up your data on your own, instead of relying on your web host to protect your information. The more backups you keep of your data, the more protected you will be. Before paying a hosting provider, ask them about their backup services and how much redundancy protection they have available.

When selecting a web host, consider how much the host costs. Some hosts charge on a per-year basis while some may be month-to-month. Look for a host that costs an average of about $5 per month as this will most likely give you a great value for your money as opposed to a free hosting site that may not offer as many options.

Make sure that you understand the difference between managed and un-managed web hosting. Those that are managed can be invaluable to you if you are not an expert yourself on the intricacies of maintaining a website. You will want to choose a managed one who has excellent availability of technical support teams.

Before choosing a web host provider, check to see how fast files can be uploaded or downloaded from their server. If this information is not readily available from them directly, use a "website speed test" service who can run a test for you. Realize, however, that accuracy varies and can be different depending on the time of day.

If you have financial restrictions, consider a free web hosting service. This hosting generally means ads will be on your site, and that you'll have limited storage space. A professional website requires paid hosting.

Weigh your web host's customer reviews in your decision. Customer satisfaction is the best way to tell how well a host performs. You can get an ideal of how their customer support operates and performs, how manageable their downtime is or any amount of other information. Do not make this your only deciding factor, as sometimes, less scrupulous companies will self-create customer reviews.

Though you may not want to think about any potential need to shut down your website in the future, don't neglect to ask about cancellation policies with a web hosting service. Inquire about contracts, refunds, and what happens to your content if you cancel your service. Ideally, there would be some way to retain the pages that you worked so hard to create.

Research the company history of providers that you're considering to be your web host. Make certain that the company has been in business for some time, and has a positive reputation. Choose a host that's been in business for a year or more. You don't want to risk your web host going out of business after you've uploaded your files to its servers. Doing this kind of research helps you find sites that are unlikely to close.

If you are looking into a host, check out the host's up-time percentage. This means find out how often they are up and running and how often they deal with downtime and have system updates and issues. The higher this percentage, the better the host will probably be and the less problems you will have with your own site, staying up and running.

When designing your site, choose tools compatible with the platform you are going to use. For instance, you will have to use a Windows-operated server if you build your site with ASP or VP while a Linux-operated server will support sites built with Python, PHP or Perl. Linux tools are a little more complex but allow you to save money on your hosting plan.

It is important to thoroughly research the shopping cart functionality of your web host if you plan to conduct business transactions through your website. You should make certain that the shopping cart supports several forms of payment including credit cards, as opposed to only PayPal. You should also find out whether it is capable of calculating shipping costs and taxes. Having shopping cart software that fulfills your needs will be essential to the success of your website.

Read the website of your host carefully. A great website is usually filled with information on the different things that you need to learn in order to optimize your website. Some services offer more resources to their clients once they open an account.

Now that you've read a bit about web hosting, use these tips to help you find the right hosting for your website. This can be a complicated issue without information, but the advice in this article has provided you with a sturdy foundation you can stand on. Best wishes with your site!
