An important part of setting up a website is finding a reliable web hosting service. There are many different services out there, and it can be difficult knowing which one to choose, since different websites will have different needs. 



The following advice should make the selection process a little bit easier.

When transferring your site between hosts, have a copy of your website at both your old and new hosts for a few days. It's important to do this because it takes 6-48 hours for the DNS to propagate. During this time, some visitors will be sent to your old website, while others whose ISPs have updated their DNS info will be sent to your new site.

Avoid choosing the cheapest web-hosting service out there, and certainly think long and hard before you go with a free one. If you are running a business online, your reputation can be severely damaged if you choose an unreliable hosting service. In addition, the free ones will often have advertisements that make it obvious you are not willing to pay for a basic service that is important to your livelihood.

Before choosing your web host, you should always try calling their technical support and ask a few questions. If you can talk to a representative right away, this means their customer service is efficient. If you cannot talk to anyone at anytime of the day or night, you should look for another service.

Research each potential web host's customer support before deciding on a host. The easier it is to get in touch with the hosting service, the more likely you are to be satisfied. If you're having problems with your web hosting account, you'll need to be able to easily reach customer service by email or phone.

You should know that not all web hosting services support Flash plug in. Using Flash on your site allows you to create a more interactive experience for your visitors, for instance with videos, games and new design possibilities. If you are not planning on using Flash, this is not a feature you should worry about.

You should always back up your data on your own, instead of relying on your web host to protect your information. The more backups you keep of your data, the more protected you will be. Before paying a hosting provider, ask them about their backup services and how much redundancy protection they have available.

Unlimited web hosting services rarely are. For instance, if a web host provides infinite disk space, there could be limitations on what file types are allowed. In addition, sometimes payment plans are tiered when unlimited options are involved, meaning you might end up spending more than you had hoped to. Try to get complete information on these different plan types. Don't just automatically assume unlimited actually means unlimited.

Before signing on to a web hosting service and choosing a plan that meets your immediate needs, check to see what the process will be if you need to upgrade at a later date. Different types of plans may, or may not, support the services that you may want to add in the future. Make sure that your current plan can be easily converted to a more complex one without the need to start from scratch.

Before deciding to ditch your current web host and go for one that is cheaper, consider the software platforms of other companies. You will want to make sure that they are compatible with your current provider, so that you can easily transfer or replicate your files. Save yourself some real headaches by choosing carefully.

Choose a web host that offers SEO help to boost site traffic. A SEO feature will allow your site to be registered with multiple search engines. However, it doesn't hurt to register your website on your own time; this allows you to include detailed information and descriptions about the site and its intended purpose.

When you are looking for a good web host, make sure that you check whether or not they offer a multiple home network. Also make sure that they are rUn by multiple bandwidth suppliers to ensure redundancy. Check and see if they offer a guarantee for network availability and up-time.

Avoid using the same company for both your web host and domain registry. Not only can you sometimes find these services cheaper if you shop for them separately, you also avoid becoming locked into one web host indefinitely. When you maintain separate web hosts and domain registries, you are free to change your website's host if you ever feel the need to, without penalty.

If you're trying to locate a great web host and you have multiple websites, you should choose a host that allows you to add on additional domains. Try to find hosts which allow unlimited domains to be added on. This way, you do not have to worry about how many websites you have. You can utilize as many as you want.

When you've finally narrowed down your search for a web hosting provider, look for one that has a satisfaction guarantee. Typically, these guarantees are valid for anywhere between one week and one month. The guarantee allows you to experience the full functionality of the web host without risk. If any issues arise that can't be resolved within the guarantee period, you'll get your money back and you can move on to a different host.

Particularly if you are considering using a web host that is small or unknown, always ask about their reliability in terms of infrastructure. Find out if the servers they utilize have redundant power, whether they have generators in case of power failure, and what kind of security is in place. This would include both online and in their physical location.

As you have seen, choosing the right web hosting service can mean the difference between success and failure for your website. Before you make this important choice, you need to do your research and know more about web hosting.
